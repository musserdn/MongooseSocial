# MongooseSocial
A backend API for a social network application, built using MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose.

## Description
It is designed to allow users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage a friend list, all while storing data in a flexible, scalable NoSQL database. The API enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users, thoughts, and reactions, offering a foundation for social networking applications.
